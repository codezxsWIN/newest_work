# Feed provenance

The offline snapshots under `data/feeds/` (gitignored — full feeds are never
committed) were fetched by the repository owner's agent on **2026-09-17**, on the
owner's explicit instruction, directly from the official publishers. The runtime
never refreshes them. Re-fetch any time with `python scripts/fetch_feeds.py`
(resumable; NVD is the long pole) and update this table.

| Feed | Official source | Fetched | Snapshot date | Rows | SHA-256 |

Fetch method: `scripts/fetch_feeds.py` / `scripts/fetch_nvd.py` — urllib
with a descriptive User-Agent, one request per ~7 s (inside NVD's public no-key
quota of 5 per rolling 30 s), retries with backoff, resumable.

Curated committed subsets for reproducible integration tests live under
`tests/fixtures/intel/` with their own provenance headers; see
`tests/fixtures/intel/PROVENANCE.md`.

What this does and does not establish: the enrichment data is now **real**
(published by CISA, Cyentia/FIRST and NIST), so CVSS vectors, EPSS percentiles
and KEV flags in reports come from the real world. It does **not** constitute
scan evidence: no real scanner captures exist yet, and RQ1–RQ4 research outcomes
remain `NOT RUN` until independent captures, host-context truth and expert
rankings arrive (`DOWNLOADS_REQUIRED.txt` §6).
